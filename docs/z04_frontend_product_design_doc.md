# Blockchain Sleuthing Platform - Interface Concept

## Overview

Based on your requirements, I'd like to present a conceptual UI/UX design for your Blockchain Sleuthing Platform that balances technical functionality with intuitive user experience. The interface is designed to support multi-blockchain investigation with dynamic strategy execution while providing real-time feedback.

## Main Interface Components

### 1. Investigation Control Panel (Left Sidebar)

This would serve as the command center for investigations:

- **Address Input Area**: A prominent field at the top where users paste blockchain addresses
- **Chain Detection**: Visual indicator showing the detected blockchain type (Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin, etc.)
- **Strategy Selection**: A set of predefined strategy cards (Token Transfers, Bridge Transfers, NFT Transfers, etc.) that users can select
- **Custom Strategy Input**: A text area where users can describe custom investigation goals
- **Strategy Queue**: A visual stack of selected strategies showing:
  - Order of execution
  - Status indicators (queued, running, completed)
  - Drag handles for reordering
  - Remove buttons for each queued strategy
- **Global Controls**: Buttons to start/pause all strategies, clear results, etc.

### 2. Graph Visualization (Central Area)

The heart of the application:

- **Interactive Network Graph**: Force-directed graph visualization where:
  - The initial address appears as a central node
  - Related addresses appear as connected nodes
  - Relationships are represented by directional edges
  - Node sizes could vary based on transaction volume or importance
- **Node Styling**: Each node would be visually coded:
  - Different colors/icons for different address types (EOA, contract, CEX, etc.)
  - Border styling to indicate verification status
  - Visual indicators for alt_wallet_candidates
- **Interactive Controls**: Zoom, pan, and focus controls to navigate the graph
- **Selection State**: Clea r visual indication when a node is selected
- **Expansion Controls**: Interface elements to expand investigation from any node

### 3. Address Details Panel (Right Sidebar)

Appears when a node is selected:

- **Address Information**: Full address with copy button, blockchain identifier, first seen date
- **Tag Collection**: Visual chips showing all tags with their sources (Etherscan, Chainalysis, etc.)
- **Transaction History**: Collapsible sections showing:
  - Incoming transactions
  - Outgoing transactions
  - Token holdings
  - NFT holdings
- **Relationship Summary**: How this address connects to the initial investigation subject
- **Action Buttons**: Options to focus graph on this node, expand investigation, add notes, etc.

### 4. Real-Time Updates Feed (Bottom Panel)

Provides streaming updates during active investigations:

- **Strategy Execution Progress**: Progress bars showing completion percentage for each active strategy
- **Discovery Timeline**: Chronological feed of discoveries made during investigation
- **Notification Area**: System messages about new nodes, completed processes, or required user input
- **Pending Validations**: Cards requiring user feedback or validation to proceed

### 5. Top Navigation Bar

Provides global application controls:

- **Investigation Management**: Save, load, or start new investigations
- **View Controls**: Toggle between graph view, list view, or split view
- **Filter Controls**: Show/hide specific node types or relationships
- **User Settings**: Access to preferences, API connections, etc.
- **Help & Documentation**: Contextual help for current investigation stage

## Key Interaction Flows

### Initial Investigation Start

1. User pastes an address into the input field
2. System automatically detects the blockchain
3. User selects multiple strategies or enters a custom goal
4. User clicks "Begin Investigation" 
5. Central area initializes with the starting address node
6. Strategy execution begins with real-time updates in the bottom panel

### Strategy Queue Management

1. User selects multiple strategies which appear in the queue
2. Each strategy shows as a card with title, description, and controls
3. User can drag to reorder strategies before execution
4. Remove buttons allow removing strategies from the queue
5. "Execute Next" button triggers the next strategy in sequence

### Node Exploration

1. User clicks on any node in the graph
2. Node becomes highlighted and centered
3. Right panel populates with detailed information about the selected address
4. Related transactions and connections are emphasized in the graph
5. User can trigger additional investigation strategies specifically for this node

### Real-Time Feedback Loop

1. As strategies execute, the graph expands with new nodes
2. Bottom panel shows progress and discoveries in real-time
3. When user validation is needed, a notification appears
4. User can provide feedback directly from the notification
5. Investigation continues based on user input

## Visual Design Direction

The interface would follow a professional, data-focused aesthetic:

- **Color Scheme**: Dark mode base with high-contrast elements for data visualization
- **Typography**: Clean, monospaced fonts for addresses and technical data with sans-serif for UI elements
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between primary controls and information displays
- **Density Control**: Options to adjust information density based on user preference
- **Responsive Considerations**: Collapsible panels and adaptable layouts for different screen sizes

## Specialized Components

### Strategy Builder Interface

For custom strategies, a guided builder that helps users articulate their investigation goals through:
- Step-by-step wizards
- Natural language inputs
- Example templates
- Visual flow builders

### Address List View

An alternative to the graph visualization that shows:
- Sortable, filterable table of all discovered addresses
- Compact representation of key metadata
- Quick-action buttons for common tasks
- Batch selection capabilities

### Investigation History Timeline

A visual representation of the investigation journey:
- Key discoveries marked on a timeline
- Strategy execution periods
- User interaction points
- Option to revert to previous investigation states

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this interface concept?
